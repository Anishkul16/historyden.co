<p>In Mahabharata Khatushyamji is the name and manifestation of Barbareek. Also called Shyam Baba, he is a very popular supernatural power. The original Sanskrit name Barbarīka is often replaced in Rajasthan by the Hindi version, Barbarīk, also spelled as Barbareek.</p>

<p>In the Skanda Purana, Barbareeka, Baliyadev  was the son of Ghatotkacha and Maurvi, daughter of Daitya Moor, a Yadava king, though other references state he is a warrior from the south. Barbareeka was originally a yaksha, reborn as a man. He was bound by his principle of always fighting on the losing side, which led him to stand witness to the battle of Mahabharata without taking part in it. In Nepali culture, Kirata King Yalamber of Nepal, is portrayed as Barbareeka while Native of Kathmandu Valley portray him as Akash Bhairav.</p>

<p>In Rajasthan, he is worshipped as Khatushyamji, and in Gujarat, he is worshipped as Baliyadev is believed to have been sacrificed before the Mahabharata war to ensure the victory of his grandfathers, the Pandavas. In return for his sacrifice, he was deified by a boon given by Krishna. He is much worshipped in Rajasthan.</p>
